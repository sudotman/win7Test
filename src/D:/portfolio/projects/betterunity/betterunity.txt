better unity is a collection of modifications/additions (scripts/prefabs) which enhance [for me] the overall flow of using the Unity Engine.

Purpose:
there are some key features pan other game engines that seem to be lacking in Unity and this is a package to resolve those problems.

mainly uses exposed editor/GUI low-level hooks/APIs inside of Unity to enable these features.
